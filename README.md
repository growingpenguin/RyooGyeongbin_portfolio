# üëã Intro

> Hello! ***"I am someone who always strives to learn and take on new challenges!"***  
> I worked as an undergraduate research assistant at the Marine Hydrodynamics AI Lab and the Mobility Research Lab <br/>  
> Through presenting as an author at both domestic and international conferences, I was able to enhance my deep learning development skills. <br/> 
> By contributing to multiple corporate projects as a student researcher, I developed expertise in AI algorithm development, creating executable (.exe) AI services, and business planning. <br/>
> Due to security concerns, only partial details and my specific roles in corporate projects are summarized, and activities from my club experience are documented ***in video form*** <br/>  
> You can find more detailed information <a href="https://www.notion.so/kimphysicsman/PROFILE-6bf254d419af4910b776c111efb371e4"> </a> about me here! <br/>

# üìùIndustry Collaborated Projects
These are the industry-academia collaboration projects I contributed to as a student researcher! <br/>  
I developed a comprehensive understanding of AI algorithm development required by companies, software functionality implementation, and overall new business planning. <br/>  
In terms of my role, as a student researcher, I particularly took ***a leading role in the deep learning prediction program***, which I conducted as part of an individual UROP project. <br/>

## 2. Marine Sloshing Data Mining & Machine Learning

> Sloshing AI Prediction  <br/>
Significant impacts occur due to sloshing during the transportation of LNG (liquefied natural gas), influenced by various factors such as the amount of liquid filled, the direction of the ship's movement, and the period and height of waves. To predict these sloshing impacts, we conducted research utilizing machine learning techniques. <br/>
> - Research Period : 2023.12-2025.01
> - Key Role : 1.Performed scaling of sloshing data based on its characteristics. 2. Conducted linear and nonlinear correlation analysis of the overall sloshing impact on the tank using machine learning.
