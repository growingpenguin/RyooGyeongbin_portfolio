# 👋 Intro

> Hello! ***"I am someone who always strives to learn and take on new challenges!"***  
> I worked as an undergraduate research assistant at the Marine Hydrodynamics AI Lab and the Mobility Research Lab <br/>  
> Through presenting as an author at both domestic and international conferences, I was able to enhance my deep learning development skills. <br/> 
> By contributing to multiple corporate projects as a student researcher, I developed expertise in AI algorithm development, creating executable (.exe) AI services, and business planning. <br/>
> Due to security concerns, only partial details and my specific roles in corporate projects are summarized, and activities from my club experience are documented ***in video form*** <br/>

# 📝Industry Collaborated Projects
These are the industry-academia collaboration projects I contributed to as a student researcher! <br/>  
I developed a comprehensive understanding of AI algorithm development required by companies, software functionality implementation, and overall new business planning. <br/>  
In terms of my role, as a student researcher, I particularly took ***a leading role in the deep learning prediction program***, which I conducted as part of an individual UROP project. <br/>
